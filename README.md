# Pet Catalog UI

Minimal React + TypeScript + Mantine scaffold for a Pet Catalog UI.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This project includes basic components:
- Pet list
- Pet profile
- Life management (health records, feeding schedule)
- Media & notes (photo gallery)
- Tools (age calculator, placeholders for notifications and analytics)

Files added to scaffold the UI; extend components under `src/components`.
